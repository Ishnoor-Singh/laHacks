In honor of his past service to our Country, Navy Seal #EddieGallagher will soon be moved to less restrictive confinement while he awaits his day in court. Process should move quickly! @foxandfriends @RepRalphNorman *()* A huge thanks to @HeatherNauert for serving America at the @StateDept. Great work! Iâ€™m proud to have you join the Fulbright board! https://t.co/oq0ZaA3MID *()*
